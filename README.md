# Thesis
An exploration of Broadcast Chromatic Numbers in restricted classes of trees.

A repository for everything code-related to do with my master's thesis, _An Exploration of Broadcast Chromatic Numbers in Restricted Classes of Trees_, to be completed c. May 2017.

      Added the Color ENUM, to provide color names/radius values/hexadecimal color values for broadcast nodes. This is mostly done for
      ease of use and to ensure consistancy later on, if/when a graphical representation is needed. The standard helper methods (getters,
      no setters, constructor, toString) were added as well.
