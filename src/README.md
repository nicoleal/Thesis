Approximating the Broadcast Chromatic Number of Graphs

A repository for everything code-related to do with my master's thesis, _Approximating the Broadcast Chromatic Number of Graphs_, to be completed c. May 2017. 

As of 20 June, 2016, this program is able to build common graphs, construct random non-cyclic graphs, and read graphs in as user input; as well as run a brute force coloring algorithim and a handful of known colorings on specific graphs.
